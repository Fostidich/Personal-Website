            Wisp is a CLI password generator that simplifies multi‑device authentication, avoiding the complexity of centralized
            password databases. I first coded a prototype in Rust (<a
                href="https://github.com/Fostidich/Secret"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Secret</a
            >), and then developed the enhanced implementation in C++ (<a
                href="https://github.com/Fostidich/Wisp"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Wisp</a
            >).<br />
            By inserting username, provider and a personal key, an hash is generated to be used as a password. Moreover, the
            format of the hash (letters, digits and symbols) can be customized, along with the number of password resets.

            I led a 4‑person team in developing a client‑server app that reproduced the MyShelfie table game. This was done for
            the Software Engineering 1 course, and was my first big coding project, which helped gain confidentiality with
            high-level programming.<br />

            has been completed with a contribution of over 30k lines of code. We adopted the MVC pattern, developing a
            well-tested core model along with an optimized client‑server network controller and a responsive GUI.

            Made for the GPUs & heterogeneous systems course,
            <a href="https://github.com/Fostidich/Fractal-Art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> program
            produces an image by first computing the graph of a fractal. Two input images are then incorporated to generate the
            final image: the first one is placed inside the fractal borders, and the other outside. A shadow effect creates the
            illusion of depth.<br />
            The naive version of the application is written in C. Following versions rely on different Cuda optimization
            techniques to lower the computational time, thanks to parallel programming.

            Many times it happens to have a folder full of different files which names contain a date.
            <a href="https://github.com/Fostidich/Time-Travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> terminal line
            app brings order to folders by extracting dates from messy filenames. All files in the specified path are scanned,
            and if a date is detected in their names, the file is renamed with a common format.<br />
            Developing this program gave me the opportunity to learn and understand how regex patterns work, and how to use them
            directly in a coding context.

            The project for the Data Structures & Algorithms course consisted in developing an efficient route planning
            algorithm for finding the shortest path in a expressway graph. The tree data structure and breadth-first search
            algorithm were to be designed from scratch, fulfilling strict time and memory constraints.

            I designed an efficient FPGA model as project for the Logical Networks course. The
            <a href="https://github.com/Fostidich/VDMR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPGA</a>
            had to read an address as a sequential input, and output the respective value to a designated exit port. Operating
            at a low structural level allowed for a perfect time optimality.
